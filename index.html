        <h3>Me and my Biography</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Why i want to be a Web Developer</strong> is a question, that
          i can answer you at everytime in any moment! I'm IT positive, I can
          feel it in my blood now since I started this Bootcamp at Neuefische.
          In the years before Neuefische I had many contacts to the world of
          Informatics, but never considered it as my next step in life. I wasn't
          ready, till now!

          <strong>What stops in IT have I encountered</strong> you may ask. I
          got my first Laptop at the age of 8 and my first Motorola at age 6.
          You'll know how fascinating it must have been to encounter such new
          technologies for the very first time in such a young age. I
          unconsciosly fell in love. I always knew every options and details of
          the Systems i had at hands. I could help anybody at any problems with
          these systems, I got very confident with them.

          I remember getting solutions for my problems like, having the music I
          like on my MP3-Player, being able to play the Games I like but
          couldn't afford ðŸ‘€ and I also knew how to punish Players in my
          favourite Multiplayer Game for hacking. I made a file look like one of
          the hacking tools they used, but it wasn't. They called me PC
          destroyer!

          Some time later i had my first Iphone 3. I learned how to customize my
          very first System by Jailbreaking it and using the package Manager
          Cydia on it. Out of interest I also worked trough the whole Book
          "Learning Python for absolute beginners" and did my first approaches
          on programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really forgot how, but i was in holidays in turkey and needed Wifi.
          I managed to hack a WPS password of one of my neighbors. I definitely
          used wiresharks.
