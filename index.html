          <p>
            <strong>Why i want to be a Web Developer</strong> is a question,
            that i can answer you at everytime in any moment! I'm IT positive, I
            can feel it in my blood now since I started this Bootcamp at
            Neuefische. In the years before Neuefische I had many contacts to
            the world of Informatics, but never considered it as my next step in
            life. I wasn't ready, till now!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>My steps to get to love IT</strong> you may ask. I got my
            first Laptop at the age of 8 and my first Motorola at age 6. You'll
            know how fascinating it must have been to encounter such new
            technologies for the very first time in such a young age. I
            unconsciosly fell in love. I always knew every options and details
            of the Systems i had at hands. I could help anybody at any problems
            with these systems, I got very confident with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember getting solutions for my problems like, having the music
            I like on my MP3-Player, being able to play the Games I like but
            couldn't afford ðŸ‘€ and I also knew how to punish Players in my
            favourite Multiplayer Game for hacking. I made a file look like one
            of the hacking tools they used, but it wasn't. They called me PC
            destroyer!
          </p>
          <p>
            Some time later i had my first Iphone 3. I learned how to customize
            my very first System by Jailbreaking it and using the package
            Manager Cydia on it. Out of interest I also worked trough the whole
            Book "Learning Python for absolute beginners" and did my first
            approaches on programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really forgot how exactly, but i was in holidays in Turkey and
            needed a Wifi connection. I managed to hack the WPS password of one
            of my neighbors. Oh man my father was buffled!
